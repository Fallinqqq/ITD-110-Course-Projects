        <h2>My Favorite Albums</h2>

        <h3><b>Bee Gees Greatest (1979)</b></h3>
        <p>
            The Bee Gees Greatest hit album became one of the most recognized
            albums of their career. It's one of those albums that make you want to
            get out of your seat and just dance and sing along with the trio.
            <br />It was also the forerunner to SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER. However, out
            of all the albums they've made together, this one is one of the most
            loved albums that the Bee Gees have made.
        </p>

        <h3>Saturday Night Fever (1977)</h3>
        <p>
            The Saturday Night Fever album is one of the
            <i>best-selling albums</i> in the international market. They sold on
            average about 40 million copies worldwide. This disco-pop album was
            full of dearly loved songs such as "Stayin Alive", "How deep is your
            love?", and "More than a Woman" <br />These few select songs from the
            Saturday Night Fever were a huge hit for the Bee Gees. The album
            itself was one of the best-selling soundtracks of all time and was
            even awarded a Grammy in the year of 1979.

        <h3>Children of the World (1976)</h3>
        <p>
            The Children of the World album was a great album for its time. One of
            its song tracks "You should be dancing" was number one on this
            10-track song album and even went on to become number one on the
            Billboard Hot 100 Chart. It was recorded by the same studio in
            Criteria Studios in Miami Florida, of which other Bee Gee albums were
            created. This album had an immense upbeat rhythm to its songs, which
            soon later resulted in it being praised as one of the most enjoyable
            light-hearted albums in Bee Gees career.
