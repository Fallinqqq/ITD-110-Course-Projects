        <h2>Thrilling Loudspeaker Experiences. Unmatched Performance for the Price.</h2>
        <p>The audio industry is literally driven by loudspeakers. They’re the final components in the signal chain, and
            the ones most likely to influence the overall sonic quality of the source material. An improperly specified
            and implemented loudspeaker can doom an otherwise competent system design. For the loudspeaker
            design/manufacturer, understanding the customer’s need is the essential first step. Only then can the
            manufacturer engineer and build a product that satisfies all criteria, including quality, performance and
            cost parameters. Loudspeakers are ubiquitous—from the PA system in a subway car to line arrays at a rock
            concert—so it’s easy to take them for granted. But understanding what goes into the design and manufacturing
            of loudspeakers can help you make smarter decisions when specifying them for a project. You’ll have better
            informed discussions with your loudspeaker manufacturer, too. An industry colleague often refers to the
            process of loudspeaker design as “one part wisdom and one part witchcraft.” Although there’s still an
            element of magic at work in designing a loudspeaker, modern design tools, materials and processes have
            replaced much of the “witchcraft” that speaker designers were forced to practice a generation ago. Most
            loudspeaker manufacturers take similar steps in the design process, but all of them have a unique approach
            that is used regardless of the speaker size.</p>

        <p>With the Prime and Ultra Series Speakers, uCorp is bringing world class sound quality to more people than
            ever before. With both 2-channel stereo and home theater surround sound systems, uCorp speakers deliver a
            truly high-end audio experience with precise imaging, absolute transparency, wide dynamic range, pinpoint
            accuracy and powerful dynamics. uCorp speakers reveal the full sonic impact of what an artist or sound
            engineer intended with perfect clarity for “like-being-there” audio experiences.</p>
