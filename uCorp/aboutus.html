      <h2>What Makes us Tick!</h2>

      <p>
        At uCorp, we believe world-class audio experiences should be within
        everyone’s reach. Our speakers, subwoofers and SoundPath audio
        accessories refute the notion that exceptional sound quality has to be
        ridiculously expensive. The uCorp design approach involves a fusion of
        leading edge technology, precision engineering, exhaustive lab and
        real-world testing, as well as, a deep personal passion for audio
        excellence, all brought to life by our acoustic engineers. With every
        new product, we strive to redefine audio performance for the price.
      </p>

      <p>
        But that’s only part of the uCorp Experience. We also stand behind our
        products with the uCorp Customer Bill of Rights, a benefits package that
        includes a 45-Day Risk-Free In-Home Trial, Fast and Free Shipping and
        Returns, our industry-leading 5-Year Unconditional Warranty, and more.
        We’re so confident you’ll love our audio gear that we made it completely
        painless to audition for yourself in the best place possible, your home.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the coherent soundstage, pinpoint imaging, superb detail and sonic
        transparency of our reference-grade loudspeakers, to the subterranean
        extension, chest-thumping slam, and unerring accuracy of our acclaimed
        subwoofers – our award-winning uCorp product line-up guarantees you a
        thrilling audio experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        And since you’re supported by uCorp Sound Experts support for the life
        of your product, you can rest easy knowing the best technical and
        customer service team on the planet is standing by to help you though
